# NIDS-Snort3-Month2
An intermediate Snort 3 project with custom rule creation, advanced attack simulations (TCP scan, SSH brute force), and alert optimization.

# 🛡️ Advanced NIDS using Snort 3 – Month 2

## 🧑‍💻 Internship: Infotact Solutions  
🔹 Role: Security Admin Associate L1  
🔹 Duration: Month 2  
🔹 Domain: Cyber Security

---

## 📘 Overview
The second month of the internship focused on enhancing detection capabilities in Snort 3. I developed and integrated **custom Snort rules**, simulated advanced attacks (TCP port scans, SSH brute force), and analyzed alert precision and false positives.

## 📅 Week-wise Work Breakdown

### ✅ Week 1
- Deep dive into Snort rule syntax
- Wrote and tested at least 2 custom detection rules
- Integrated custom rules into `snort.lua`

### ✅ Week 2
- Simulated attacks:
  - TCP Port Scan
  - SSH Brute Force
- Verified alerts for new custom rules
- Analyzed accuracy and detection quality

### ✅ Week 3
- Identified and suppressed false positives
- Fine-tuned rules for better precision
- Adjusted noise thresholds

### ✅ Week 4
- Compiled final report:
  - Rule details
  - Attack simulation results
  - Alert analysis
- (Optional) Created demo slides and screenshots

- Alert logs for custom rules
- Snort terminal detection output
- Simulation traffic (Nmap, Hydra, etc.)

View them in [`/screenshots`](./screenshots) folder.
